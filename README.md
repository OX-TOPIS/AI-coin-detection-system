# AI coin detection system
#### Coin detection and counting system is an AI that will help count the amount of money. This AI will save time in counting the amount. and make the amount count more accurate We use Python language and two libraries, OpenCV and NumPy. amount from camera To be able to make videos and images, the AI ​​will be able to figure out what each coin is and how much of each coin.
## development guidelines
#### 1. Train AI by adding more positive and negative images to make AI more accurate.
#### 2. Make AI work faster.
#### 3. Add an xml file for detecting 2 baht coins.
## Limitations of AI
#### 1. The 10 baht coin and the 5 baht coin must be placed on the head side only. The 1 baht coin must be placed on the tail side only because the 5 baht coin and 1 baht coin have similar appearance and color
#### 2. Each coin should be placed at least about 3 centimeters apart, because if they are placed close to each other, the detection accuracy will be less, as shown in Figure 8.
